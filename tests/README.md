These tests require [the nose testing framework](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/) 
to run.  Once you've got it installed, you can run them just like this:

### Run all tests

```bash
$ cd /path/to/this/directory
$ nosetests __init__.py
```


### Run just the traceroute tests

```bash
$ cd /path/to/this/directory
$ nosetests traceroute
```
