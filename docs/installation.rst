Using pip
=========

The quickest and easiest way to install Sagan is to use ``pip``:::

    $ pip install ripe.atlas.sagan


From GitHub
===========

If you're feeling a little more daring and want to use whatever is on GitHub,
you can have pip install right from there:::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/ripe.atlas.sagan.git


From a Tarball
==============

If for some reason you want to just download the source and install it manually,
you can always do that too.  Simply un-tar the file and run the following in the
same directory as ``setup.py``.::

    $ python setup.py install
